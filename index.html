        <p>Bonjour! nice to meet you. I was born and raised in St.Andrew, Jamaica.
          I attended New Hope Basic School, St.Judes Primary School and Convent Of Mercy Academy "Alpha". 
          After graduating highschool, I had several goals to accomplished.
          I'm coming from humble beginnings which I'm very grateful for and
          to see the young lady that I'm evolving into.
          I love my alone time and spend some of it with God.
          I aspire to be a true Woman Of God, sucessful and educative.
          The Dynamic web development course is quite intriguing and I'm looking forward to learn more about webpages
          and using it in my future endeavours. 
        </p>
